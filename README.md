# CPPwithMiyoshi-01VarsAndConsts

This is the first repository that readers of my book [C++ with Miyoshi](https://amzn.to/3bQuePT) (the link might be considered an ad) or its companion repository [CPPwithMiyoshi](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/CPPwithMiyoshi) are instructed to clone.  It is starter code for the Variables and Constants problem (GS01-05).  You can get to all the [problems](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/CPPwithMiyoshi/tree/master/Problems) by clicking the link.

If you need help cloning this repository from Visual Studio, you can find that [here](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/CPPwithMiyoshi/blob/master/CloneRepo.md) or in any number of places in the internet.
